NAME
    Perinci::Access::Base - Base class for all Perinci Riap clients

VERSION
    version 0.29

DESCRIPTION
    This is a thin base class for all Riap clients ("Perinci::Access::*").
    It currently only provides check_request() to do some basic sanity
    checking of the Riap request hash $req. It also provides a barebones
    "new()".

METHODS
  new(%args) => OBJ
    Constructor. Does nothing except creating a blessed hashref from %args.
    Subclasses should override this method and do additional stuffs as
    needed.

  check_request($req) => RESP|undef
    Should be called by subclasses during the early phase in "request()".
    Will return an enveloped error response on error, or undef on success.
