NAME
    Perinci::Access::Base - Base class for all Perinci Riap clients

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.31 of Perinci::Access::Base (from Perl
    distribution Perinci-Access-Base), released on 2014-10-23.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a thin base class for all Riap clients ("Perinci::Access::*").
    It currently only provides check_request() which does the following:

    *   perform some basic sanity checking of the Riap request hash $req

    *   split request keys "uri"

        Split result is put in "$req->{-uri_scheme}", "$req->{-uri_auth}",
        "$req->{-uri_path}", "$req->{-uri_query}", and "$req->{-uri_frag}".

METHODS
  new(%args) => OBJ
    Constructor. Does nothing except creating a blessed hashref from %args.
    Subclasses should override this method and do additional stuffs as
    needed.

  check_request($req) => RESP|undef
    Should be called by subclasses during the early phase in "request()".
    Will return an enveloped error response on error, or undef on success.
